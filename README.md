# Python_TouchdesignerStubsFromWiki
This allows you to use native typehints for your touchdesigner scripts. 
Download the typings folder and unpack them in the root of your project.
Open the root directory in code and use as usual.

To get autocompleation, use typeAnnotations.
```python
myOperator:moviefileinTOP = op("movefilein1")
```
Now, use dot-notation to get autoComplet with docs:

Parameters currently do not support typespecific help, i.E. enums for Menus or typeHinting, which will come in the future.
