Turning this option on will disable some advanced features in the Render TOP, as well as anti-aliasing.		

				

The feature is a pixel-based approach, not object-based. So its performance is not directly related to the number of objects, but rather how they are layered.				

				

It uses a technique called Depth Peeling. First you render the normal frame. On your next render you peel away all of the pixels you saw in the first frame, and reveal the pixels underneath them. The next frame you do the same, peeling away the pixels you could see from the 2nd render. And so on. Once all of the renders are done, you re composite each layer Over the other, starting at the farthest back layer.				

				

If you take a sphere for example, you'll need to do 2 passes, the first one for the front of the sphere, and then 2nd will be the inside of the sphere.				

				

If you have 10 spheres, one behind the other. You'll need 19-20 passes to get the correct image.				

				

If you have 10 spheres, each next to each other across the screen, you'll only need 2 passes.				

				

In reality though you will only need 3-5 passes to get an image that's acceptable. It may not be 100% correct, but it'll look pretty close to correct.

Then another render is done but the closest pixels that were occluded by the previous pass are written to the color buffer instead. This can be done multiple times, each time peeling back farther into the scene.

From the perspective of digital audio, a signal level which varies between '+1 <-> -1' is at a volume level of '0' decibels, because it is not possible for a digital system to respresent any values larger than '+1 <-> -1'.  Instead, they will simply be clipped as they proceed to the output device.

For example, after an excessively loud tone burst, the limiter's gain may have been pushed up to an extreme value. This extreme value will take a long time to be fully released.

This weights point 0 to three regions (actually only two because the first entry has a weight of zero).

 0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 1.0			

 0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 2.0
