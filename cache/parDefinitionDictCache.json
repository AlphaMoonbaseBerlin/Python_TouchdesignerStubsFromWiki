For example, if the channels are keyed from frame 1 to 600, you can connect an input to the component and manually drive the animation output by feeding it a number between 1 and 600 (indexes outside the range will use the channel extend conditions). \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nUsing the Keyframe CHOP's Index Units menu, you can drive the animation with numbers expressed in seconds, samples, or a fraction where 0 is the start and 1 is the end.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Animation Component Outputs'''\t\t\t\nThe CHOP output gives access to the animation channel's current value. CHOPs can be directly connected or a [[Null CHOP]] may be appended for [[CHOP Export|exporting]] the channels to parameters. The current channel values can also be viewed by turning on the Animation Component's [[Node Viewer|node viewer]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n[[image:AnimationCOMPTimesliced.png|right]]",

The movement of the chain of Bone Components is \"solved\" or computed based on several methods including Inverse Kinematics. The parenting attribute of bones is unique in that each bone attaches to the end, not the origin, of the parent bone.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt is recommended that you use the Bone Creation state, accessed through the state icons above the Viewport, to construct such a chain because placing individual Bone Components and establishing their parenting relationships from operator to operator is extremely time consuming and not at all intuitive. In addition, a chain created using the Bone state will produce a better behaved bone chain. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nBy default, bones do not render. They contain two types of display geometry: \"link geometry\" and \"capture region geometry\". The former consists of a narrow diamond shape which has been stretched to the length specified in ''Bone Length'', and placed along the Bone Component's negative Z-axis. The latter consists of two or more user-controllable ellipses that are used to define capture regions used in skeleton sops. You can specify whether either of the two types of geometry are displayed. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe actual movement of the Bone Components is controlled through an IK CHOP (when using the standard Capture/Deform model). This is effected through an expression in the '''Transform''' channels of the Bone Component. If you want to override this behaviour, then you need to delete the bone's translate channels such that they are no longer over-ridden by chop control. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you make a bone the child of a non-bone Component, then it will attach to the origin of that Component. If you want to reposition the bone relative to its non-bone parent, you must remove the expression in the bone's translate parameters.",

A Bullet Solver COMP contains any number of actors/bodies (Actor COMPs) or forces ([[Force COMP]]/[[Impulse Force COMP]]), and as the name suggests it also uses the [https://pybullet.org/wordpress/ Bullet Physics API] to step through the simulation. \n   \nThe Bullet Solver COMP runs a Bullet simulation based on some simulation parameters (eg. linear multiplier or angular multiplier) and updates the transformations of the Actor COMPs contained within it as the simulation progresses forward. The simulation can be paused, slowed down, sped up, or restarted using the parameters on the COMP. \n\nThe Bullet Solver COMP simulation operates in a vacuum, so there will be no air resistance applied to any actors in the simulation. The simulation is stepped at the given sample rate, and the Actor COMP transform is updated accordingly. These transformations are the same results displayed in the [[Bullet Solver CHOP]]. \n \nThe Actor COMPs referenced by the Bullet Solver COMP do not need to be inside its network. They can be anywhere as long as they are not already referenced by another Bullet Solver COMP.\n\nSee also: [[Bullet Dynamics]], [[Actor COMP]], [[Force COMP]], [[Impulse Force COMP]], [[Constraint COMP]], [[Bullet Solver CHOP]].",

Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm. \n\nIf a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.\n\nIf a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint COMP. Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.\n\nIf a slider constraint is applied to a single body, then that body's translation/rotation will be constrained to just that axis. In other words, the body can only move along that axis (either direction) and can only rotate along that axis (either direction).\n    \nSee also: [[Bullet Dynamics]], [[Bullet Solver COMP]], [[Actor COMP]], [[Force COMP]], [[Impulse Force COMP]], [[Bullet Solver CHOP]].",

        "long": "The FBX COMP imports geometry, animations and scenes using the FBX file format from Maya, 3DS Max, Cinema4D, Houdini and others.\nThe FBX COMP currently uses the 2019.0 version of the FBX SDK.\n\n[https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview FBX] is a file format and set of libraries from Autodesk that is used to exchange models, animations and image/texture data between applications. The FBX COMP reads FBX files and supports most of its features. You can drag-drop a <code>.fbx</code> into a TouchDesigner network or import it via the File > Import File... menu. The FBX COMP can also import meshes from .obj and .4ds files, see also [[File Types]].\n\nThe assets from the FBX file are saved into a \"<code>.tdc</code>\" file with the same name as the FBX file inside the <code>TDImportCache</code> folder, which is created next to your <code>.toe</code> file. Assets are read from the \"<code>.tdc</code>\" file using Import Select OPs ([[Import Select TOP]] / [[Import Select SOP]] / [[Import Select CHOP]]). Upon reloading a <code>.toe</code> file, the assets can be imported directly from the \"<code>.tdc</code>\" cache, and the FBX file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \"<code>.tdc</code>\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the FBX file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \"<code>.tdc</code>\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open an FBX file in an FBX COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"FBX File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct <code>.fbx</code> extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the FBX COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Import\" button to generate the FBX network and import the assets. Note that we recommend changing the \"Import Method\" to to other modes (less work) can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Import\" button requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Merge with Existing\", the \"Import\" pulse will reload the internal assets (e.g. meshes, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the <code>.toe</code> file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) With the \"Import Method\" menu set to \"Import Assets (Import Selects)\", the \"Import\" button is used when some changes on FBX file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\n'''Animation channels''': When there is animation in the FBX file, use the controls on the Play page to initialize, start and guide the animation. Also create an [[Info CHOP]] and attach it to the FBX COMP to watch its animation timing. The Info CHOP channels are similar to those of the [[Timer CHOP]].\n\n'''Textures''': Textures can either be embedded within the FBX file or external and referenced by a path to a texture file. For example, Blender has an option during FBX export to embed, otherwise they'll be external. If they're external then they may be exported with an absolute path to the texture file, which means if you move the FBX file to a different machine or relocate the file, then the textures will fail to load. In this case, if you are unable to re-export to embed the textures, then you can instead specify a search directory using the Texture Directory parameter so that the FBX COMP knows where to locate the texture files at import.\n\nSee also: [[FBX]], [[Import Select CHOP]], [[Import Select TOP]], [[Import Select SOP]], [[USD COMP]]",

[[Bullet Dynamics|Bullet]] supports linear/rotational forces and impulse forces (see Force page) and [[Flex]] supports force fields (see Force Field page).\n\n===<div class=\"subSectionLineDialog\">Active Force</div>===\n\nActive forces are enabled using the Active toggle parameter on the Force page.\n\nAn active force will create a force in the simulation that is applied over time. An active force can either be applied globally by being referenced on the [[Bullet Solver COMP]], or it can be applied locally by being referenced on an individual [[Actor COMP]]. The active force applies its force each frame, and the force applied over 1 second is equivalent to an impulse force of the same value applied in a single frame. \n    \nThe units for the force and torque parameters are in Newtons (N), equivalent to kg*m/s^2. This means that if a force of 10N is applied to an actor with mass equal to 5kg and no initial velocity, then after 1 second the velocity of that actor will be 2m/s => 10N / 5kg * 1 sec = 2m/s. If all the parameters were the same, but instead it was an impulse force, then the velocity would still be 2m/s. However, the impulse force's velocity would change instantaneously and stop increasing (unless pulsed again) whereas with the active force the velocity will continue to increase after 1 second.\n\nThe center of mass is assumed to be center of the bounding box of the mass. By default, if a body is not constrained and not colliding, the force will not cause the body to rotate, unless the Relative Position parameter is set to a non-zero value.  If Relative Position is set to +1 in X and the force is +1 in Y, it will cause the body to rotate counter-clockwise around the Z-axis and translate in Y.\n\nIf the Torque is set to +1 in Z, it will cause the body to only rotate counter-clockwise in the Z-axis (a positive Z rotation), and not translate.\n\nTo apply force/torque to specific bodies use a Feedback CHOP (see [[Bullet Solver COMP]] or [[Actor COMP]]) and '''force[xyz]''' and '''torque[xyz]''' channels.\n\n===<div class=\"subSectionLineDialog\">Impulse Force</div>===\n\nImpulse forces are applied through the Impulse Force pulse parameter.\n\nAn impulse force pulse will create a force in the simulation that is applied for 1 frame. In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in [[Bullet Dynamics|Bullet]] this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.  \n    \nThe resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as an active force with the same values if the active force is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of impulse force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg * 1sec = 2m/s. \n\n===<div class=\"subSectionLineDialog\">Force Field</div>===\n\nForce fields are enabled through the Active parameter on the Force Field page.\n\nForce fields are spherical with a radius defined through the Radius parameter. Positive strength pushes bodies outward and negative strength pulls bodies inward.\n\n\nSee also: [[Flex]], [[Bullet Dynamics]], [[Bullet Solver COMP]], [[Actor COMP]], [[Constraint COMP]], [[Bullet Solver CHOP]], [[Nvidia Flex TOP]], [[Nvidia Flex Solver COMP]].",

This allows a default value to be used for all rows, but allowing select rows to have different settings as needed. Transforms are not overridden, any transform that is given is applied as a pre-transform before the other transforms given by the parameters. Valid columns are currently: <code>text, tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz, sx, sy, sz, px, py, pz, ltx, lty, ltz, lrx, lry, lrz, lsx, lsy, lsz, lpx, lpy, lpz, fontcolorr, fontcolorg, fontcolorb, fontalpha, allignx, aligny, alignymode, fontsize, tracking, skew, horzstretch, linespacing, wordwrap, layoutsizew, layoutsizeh, layoutanchoru, layoutanchorv, textpaddingl, textpaddingr, textpaddingb, textpaddingt, render, append, localxform</code>.",

        "long": "The Geo Text COMP renders text in 3D. It does not read or generate a SOP as it does direct rendering using the [[Slug Library]] and can be lit and textured with any [[MAT]] material.\n\nYou can set fonts, colors, sizes, bold, italic, tracking, multi-lines like you can with the [[Text COMP]]. But because the Geo Text COMP doesn't have a boundary, width or height like the Text COMP, we substitute it with a layout box and the Layout Box parameters. The layout box has a width and height, and by default the bottom left of the layout box is placed at 0,0,0 in 3D space of the Geo Text COMP (\"object space\").  The Layout Box Anchor U and V let you put the center of the layout box at 0,0,0 by setting the anchors to .5, 5.\n\nThe layout box's size although you can't see it by default, is the Layout Box Size parameter.  With that you can right-justify or top-justify text in the layout box, and clip to the layout box.  Yu can also pad space aroud each side of the layout box.\n\nSee also the 2D equivalent [[Text COMP]]. See [[Text Formatting Codes]] for ways to override settings per-character.\n\n'''Render multiple strings transformed separately''': The Specification DAT and Specification CHOP allow for individual strings to be each positioned and styled independently in 3D. \n\nEvery row of the Spec DAT represents a \"block\" or \"text block\". Every Spec DAT contains a column named <code>text</code> which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.\n\nMost columns override a Geo Text COMP parameter, such as <code>text</code>, <code>tx</code> and <code>fontsize</code>. Some column names noted below have no corresponding parameter.\n\nThe Spec CHOP can also specify values per block. When including a Spec CHOP the number of Spec CHOP samples needs to be the same number of rows as the Spec DAT following the first column header. \n\nParameters that can be overrided include <code>fontsize</code>, <code>fontcolor</code>, tracking etc., plus all the layout box and alignment parameters. Font/bold/italic are supported as columns as they are separate fonts. \n\n'''Transforming text blocks''': The column or channel names can include <code>tx</code>, <code>ty</code>, <code>tz</code> and all the rotate and scale channels (which use the Transform Order parameter). \n\nA special column/channel called <code>append</code> can be used, when <code>append</code> is <code>1</code>, to position one block of text relative to the end of the previous block. Regular transforms are inherited by each appended text block. \n\nLocal transforms (<code>ltx</code>, <code>lrz</code>, etc), can be used to apply additional transforms to a block that are not inherited by appended blocks. If the special column/channel <code>localxform</code> is set to '<code>pre</code>', then the local transform is applied in world space before the inherited transforms are applied.\n\n'''Note''' - The Geo Text COMP uses '''blending/transparency''' to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view  properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the [[#Parameters_-_Render_Page|Draw Priority]] parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. '''Note''': Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.\n\nSee OP Snippets for further transform options - <code>relative</code> and <code>append</code>.\n\nThe Geo Text COMP is similar to the [[Text COMP]] which is a 2D [[Panel]]."

In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in [[Bullet Dynamics|Bullet]] this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.  \n    \nThe resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as the [[Force COMP]] with the same values if the Force COMP is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of Impulse Force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg * 1sec = 2m/s. \n\nSee also: [[Bullet Dynamics]], [[Bullet Solver COMP]], [[Actor COMP]], [[Force COMP]], [[Constraint COMP]], [[Bullet Solver CHOP]]."

The replicant master can be a full component and its contents or a single node. \t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt takes the node specified in the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Master Node</span> parameter, and makes a copy of the master for every row in the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Template Table</span> (or specified by the Number of Replicant parameter).\t\n\t\t\t\nThe nodes that are created can be named in two ways. Copies can be named/numbered sequentially using\t\t\t\nthe prefix specified by the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Node Prefix</span> parameter: <code>item1</code>, <code>item2</code>, ... Alternately, copies can be named based on the string in a column of the table, specified with the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Name from Table</span> parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n[[Image:Replicator.1.png|700px]]\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you want to create a node for the first row of the table, un-set the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Ignore First Row</span> parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe replicants get laid out in a grid in the network, determined by the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Layout</span> and <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Layout Origin</span> parameters.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Replicator does not assume or require that the master and replicants are components \u2013 they can all be Movie File In TOPs if you want. It also does not assume or require that the replicants are [[Clone]]s.  However the <span class=\"tipTextCOMP\">Master Node</span> can be a component whose [[Clone]] parameter is set to itself, so that all nodes created are clones of the master.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor every replicant, you can run a script in the callback DAT where you can see some examples of typical cases that you can adapt.

In the callback DAT, removing <code>onRemoveReplicant()</code> will keep the replicants around to be re-used when the table grows again.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThis is an extremely powerful node type. Examples: (1) A button gadget for each row of the table. a geometry component, which is replicated at every point of a 3D particle system, each behaving separately.

The text can be view-only, view-only but copy/pasteable, or be fully editable directly in the panel. \n    \nThere are '''formatting''' modes for displaying single-line strings and multi-line text, floating point and integer numbers, password fields and more. The source of the text comes from the Text parameter and it is then formatted for display in the panel. Formatting examples include displaying a number as a currency, percent or scientific notation, or converting an integer timecode value to hours/minutes/seconds/frames. Other formatting options include support for Python syntax, Custom C++ Fmt and Custom Python F-String syntax.\n\nWhen a user clicks in the panel to edit the text, the contents are displayed in a raw format and then formatted again once the editing is completed.\n\nThe Text COMP supports '''[[Text Formatting Codes|inline formatting directives]]''' in the text for things like color, strikeouts, underlines, small caps, subscripts, gradients, etc. For example, the code <code>{#color(255, 0, 0);}</code> will turn all text that follows on that line red.\n\nIt has '''text-fitting''' options for wraparound, shrinking text if it doesn't fit, left-center-right alignment and language reading direction. View-only text can be selectable or not selectable.\n\nYou can draw '''multiple transformed/formatted strings using a \"Specification DAT\" table''': It draws one string per row of the table, each with its own position and formatting in your panel. Columns can be <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>text</code>, <code>fontsize</code>, <code>fontcolorr</code>, <code>fontcolorg</code>, <code>fontcolorb</code>, <code>fontalpha</code>, <code>skew</code>, <code>tracking</code> and <code>horzstretch</code>.\n\nIt has '''python callbacks''' that can be executed for every character or string that has changed, and a callback for change of focus.\n\n'''Resolution-independent text''' is drawn directly to the screen at the resolution required for the panel size, resulting in perfectly crisp text at all zoom levels. It is GPU-based using the [[Slug Library]].\n\nUnits for X, Y, Width and Height are in \"'''panel units'''\" whereas they were actual pixel units before. Default Font Size, Text Offsets and Padding are in panel units.\n\nSee [[Text Formatting Codes]]\n\nSee also [[Geo Text COMP]] for the 3D rendered equivalent of the Text COMP.\n\nNote: The Text COMP is a replacement for the [[Field COMP]], completely replacing it and adding many new features not previously available."

Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD COMP. You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also [[File Types]].\n\nThe assets from the USD file are saved into a \"<code>.tdc</code>\" file with the same name as the USD file inside the TDImportCache folder, which is created next to your toe file. Assets are read from the \"<code>.tdc</code>\" file using Import Select OPs ([[Import Select TOP]] / [[Import Select SOP]] / [[Import Select CHOP]]). Upon reloading a <code>.toe</code> file, the assets can be imported directly from the \"<code>.tdc</code>\" cache, and the USD file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \"<code>.tdc</code>\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the USD file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \"<code>.tdc</code>\" will be saved out.\n\nTo open a USD file in an USD COMP:\n\n1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n\n2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build Network\" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge Geometry\" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build Network\" requires the network to be built again.\n\n3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the <code>.toe</code> file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n\n4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n\nHere are some examples: https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/\n\nSee also: [[USD]], [[USD In TouchDesigner]], [[Import Select CHOP]], [[Import Select TOP]], [[Import Select SOP]], [[FBX COMP]]",

Make sure to check with the [https://www.ultraleap.com/ UltraLeap website] regarding any applicable licenses that you may need for your project.\n\n==== Installation ====\nAs of TouchDesigner 2022, the Leap Motion library files are no longer included with the TouchDesigner installer. These files, along with the drivers, are available from the UltraLeap website here: https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases\n* API Version 5 Gemini - Download Gemini v5.6.1\n* API Version 4 Orion - Download Orion Beta v4.1.0\n* API Version 2 Tracking - Download Orion Beta v3.2.1\n\nDepending on your operating system, there are different instructions for installing the library:\n\n'''On Windows:''' You can use the Library Folder parameter to point to the location of the LeapC.dll (Orion/Gemini) or Leap.dll (Version 2/3) files on your system. The file is installed as part of the LeapSDK and the location may vary depending on the version and options selected during installation.\n\n'''On MacOS:''' Requires legacy Mac driver available [https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases/mac-2-3-1 here]. The libLeap.dylib file must be copied into a folder where TouchDesigner can find it (the Library folder parameter is not available on MacOS). The file is available in the LeapSDK/lib folder of the driver package downloaded from UltraLeap. The file can be copied into <code>usr/local/lib</code> so that it is available to all copies of TouchDesigner on the system, or it can be copied into the frameworks folder inside the package contents of a particular TouchDesigner app i.e. <code>TouchDesigner.app/contents/frameworks</code>.\n\nSee also [[Leap Motion]], [[Leap Motion CHOP]]",

        "long": "'''Note:''' This TOP uses the Nvidia Hardware Encoder to create the stream and therefore requires an Nvidia GPU and Windows to operate.\n    \nThe Video Stream Out TOP creates either an [[RTSP]] server, or can act as an [[RTMP]] or [[SRT]] sender, to send H.264 video and MP3 audio across the network. It uses Nvidia's hardware H264 encoder. For RTSP, it can handle multiple clients connecting to it at the same time. Multiple Video Stream Out TOPs using the same port will be handled using the same underlying RTSP server. The Video Stream Out TOP can also be used to send a video stream through [[WebRTC]] video/audio tracks.\t\n\n===== RTSP =====\nObtain the URL to connect to the Video Steam Out TOP's RTSP server by using an Info DAT or by middle clicking on the node. It will be in the form:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<code>rtsp://<ipaddress>:<port>/<streamName></code>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ne.g.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<code>rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/tdvidstream</code>\t\t\t\n\n===== RTMP =====\nTo obtain the RTMP URL stream to, you may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using. This should be in the format:\n\n<code>{service url}/{stream key}</code>. \n\nFor example for Twitch the URL would be something like\n\n<code>rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY</code>\n\nFor more information on different services checkout  [[RTMP]].\n\n===== SRT =====\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Reliable_Transport SRT] can use either H.264 or H.265 video codec. It can also send per-frame metadata when a CHOP or DAT is specified in the Per-Frame Metadata parameter. The SRT server is settings are controlled by URL options. E.g to create a listener you'd specify the URL:\n\n<code>srt://0.0.0.0:9494?mode=listener</code>\n\nTo connect to listener, you'd do:\n\n<code>srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller</code>\n\nEither side of the connection can be the listener or the caller, it doesn't matter which is sending the video and which is receiving the video. The receiver would set their mode to be the opposite of whatever the sender is setting their mode to be.\n\nAll the options that are available are listed [https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#srt here]. Multiple options can be set using a & as separator. E.g\n\n<code>srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller&send_buffer_size=100000</code>\n\nSRT sent from the Video Stream Out TOP can include per-frame metadata making it easy to send and receive CHOP/DAT data in sync with video. It can be read with the [[Video Stream In TOP]].\n\n\n===== Limitations =====\nRTSP streaming does not support sending directly to another RTSP server via RTP.\n\nThe maximum stream outs on a NVIDIA Geforce card is 2: The number of streams the GPU can handle is different depending on driver versions and hardware, however in general it is 2 streams max on Geforce level cards. Using a lower resolution does not avoid the 2 stream limit. Quadros can do more streams.\tRefer to [https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new Nvidia Video GPU Support Matrix] for more information.\n\t\t\t\nOne test using the default TouchDesigner startup file on a M6000 was able to do 13 1080p@30hz Video Stream Out TOPs.\t\t\t\n\nSee also the [[Video Stream In TOP]], [[RTMP]], [[RTSP]] and [[Video Streaming User Guide]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor other protocols over IP see [[NDI|NDI (Network Data Interface)]], and [[Touch Out TOP]] / [[Touch In TOP]].\n\n'''NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.'''",

The Operator contains two types of dynamic control: compression and limiting.\t\t\nIt is recommended that you [[link]] this CHOP to an [[Info CHOP]], so that you can have some visual feedback:  The amount of compression or limiting which is being applied will be displayed in the Info CHOP.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Compressor'''\t\t\t\nThe goal of a compressor is to reduce the amplitude of a signal when it crosses a certain threshold, while introducing little to no harmonic distortion.  The desired threshold is set by the user, and the amount of compression to be applied is determined by the compression ratio.  The attack and release parameters determine how quickly the compression will be applied and released, as incoming signal goes above and below the threshold.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Limiter'''\t\t\t\nThe purpose of a limiter is to ensure a signal is within a certain dynamic range, while introducing as little harmonic distortion as possible.  Unlike the compressor, the goal is not to apply a smooth or musical form of dynamic control, but instead to keep the signal within a 'safe' range that is compatible with any CHOPS that are downstream (for example, an Audio Device Out).  This means that the Limiter has a much more abrupt (instant) attack value, which cannot be adjusted by the user.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nInput 2: '''Side Chain Channels''' - Other audio channels coming in can be used to determine the gains that are applied to the audio channels of the first input.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''NOTE''': This is a useful article for procedurally [http://gameaudionoise.blogspot.co.uk/p/all-in-mix-importance-of-real-time.html mixing audio for games].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee [[Audio Filter CHOP]], [[Audio Para EQ CHOP]], [[Audio Band EQ CHOP]], [[Audio Spectrum CHOP]]\t\t\t\nSee also: [[Envelope CHOP]].",

A band pass filter is used to extract a frequency range (i.e. extracting a person's voice from background noise) and a band reject filter is used to cut out a frequency range.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf a certain frequency lies outside the pass band, sounds at that frequency will be reduced in magnitude. The farther outside the pass band the frequency is, the more it will be reduced.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Cutoff frequency is also known as the \"half-power\" frequency. A wave at the cutoff frequency will be reduced to half power.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Rolloff of a filter determines how quickly the drop occurs at its Cutoff frequencies. A low rolloff will produce a gradual filter falloff (more of the sounds outside the frequency range are heard), and a high rolloff will produce a sharp filter falloff.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nRefer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_filter audio filter] for more insight.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can see the effects of the Audio Filter CHOP by passing it white noise from an Oscillator CHOP and sending the result to an Audio Spectrum CHOP.

        "long": "The Audio Oscillator CHOP generates sounds in three ways. It repeats common waveforms (sine, triangle), it generates white noise (a random number for each sample), or it repeats a prepared incoming audio clip of any duration. It outputs typically 44100 samples per second. In contrast, the [[LFO CHOP]] by default generates waves at lower frequencies and lower sample rates (60 samples/second), however both Audio Oscillator and LFO are interchangeable by changing their frequencies and sample rates.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhen it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, the Audio Oscillator CHOP steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Pitch Control input. By default, a Pitch Control of 0 gives a middle A at 440 Hz; a 1 gives 880 Hz; a -1 gives 220 Hz. Steps of 1 in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart. Steps of 1/12 (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.\t\n\nThe Audio Oscillator is roughly modelled after the [https://www.google.com/search?q=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design&oq=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design APR 2600 voltage-controlled oscillator] (VCO).\n\t\t\t\nUp to three input CHOPs can be connected to the Audio Oscillator CHOP.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Pitch Control''' - The first (optional) input affects the pitch. Output channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. When pitch control is 0, it outputs a wave at the base frequency (default 440 Hz at 44,100 samples per second). It is \"logarithmic\": By default, increasing the pitch control by 1 increases the pitch by 1 octave, by 2 it increases by 2 octaves (4 times the frequency).\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Reset Pulse''' - The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. 0 in the input means \"play the oscillator\". 1 means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback Source\".\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Playback Source''' - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. The waveform Type and the Base Frequency parameters are disabled.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you plug any sound clip into the Audio Oscillator CHOP's Playback Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of 0 of any duration, it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a [[Wave CHOP]] as its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the input.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Audio Oscillator CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. 0 pitch is normal speed, 1 is double speed.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nUnlike the Wave CHOP, this is an iterating CHOP, that is, it steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this effect, feed an LFO CHOP into the Audio Oscillator. Unlike the LFO CHOP, the Audio Oscillator CHOP is designed for audio frequencies.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[LFO CHOP]], [[Wave CHOP]].",

The Boost parameter, when it is greater than 0, will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can best hear the effects of the Audio Para EQ CHOP by passing it rich-spectrum music.

When converting a signal to its spectrum, two channels are created from the one containing the audio signal. One channel contains the magnitude of the frequency components, and the other contains the phase. The channels are named, for example <code>chan1_m</code> and <code>chan1_p</code> where <code>_m</code> and <code>_p</code> are the suffixes for the magnitude and phase channels.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Tip''':  You can reduce cook time if you decrease the FFT Size from its default 8192 samples. The fastest form of this CHOP is by setting the Output Length parameter to \"Output Length Manually\". For example set the output buffer size to 2048 samples and the FFT Size to 2048. Each time it cooks, the CHOP is looking at the latest 2028 samples (at 44.1 KHz that amounts to the 50 msec, or 3 frames), which is plenty. Note the default form of the CHOP gives you 22,000 samples: 1 Hz to 22,050 Hz in steps of 1 Hz (when set to Frequency vs Logarithmic scaling), designed for clear interpretation: sample 1000 is the level of audio at 1000 Hz.\t\n\n'''Tip''':  To find the exact frequency of a wave entering the Audio Spectrum CHOP, look at the Info pop-up for that node (MMB on the node).

In order to get the full benefit of the bidirectional nature of the plugin parameters it is recommended to use [[Binding]] or a [[Bind CHOP]] when driving the parameter in TouchDesigner, rather than an expression or CHOP reference.\n\nPython calls let you [[AudiovstCHOP_Class|send MIDI messages]] to the plugin. And if the plugin generates MIDI, you can get and process the messages in the [[Docking|docked]] callbacks DAT.\n\nDepending on the plugin, the Audio VST CHOP takes up to 4 multi-channel inputs.\n    \nSee the discussion on which VST plugins work well with TouchDesigner - [https://derivative.ca/community-post/vst-plugin-testing/65712 VST Plugin Testing]. Also for a selection of free VSTs along with a useful set of affordable upgraded versions go here: https://hy-plugins.com.\n\n2 Free HY-Plugins are included with TouchDesigner and can be found using the Help > Browse Samples menu. This will open a file browser to the TouchDesigner application Samples folder which contains a VST3 folder holding one synthesizer and filter plugin for both Windows and MacOS. The Windows VST3 plugin files can be distinguished by their included \"64 Bit\" string.\n\nInstalled VST plugins are found in <code>C:Program Files/Common Files/VST</code> on Windows, and be <code>/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3</code> on macOS.\n\n'''Tip''': You can get detailed info about the VST plugin by attaching an [[Info DAT]] to the CHOP.\n\n[[VST]] is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, registered in Europe and other countries."

It monitors the matched channels and updates the Bind CHOP's output channel to match whichever input changed most recently. When bound to a parameter (via Export mode or Bind mode) changes to any matched input or the bound parameter will update the channel's value.\n\nA 'Callbacks DAT' is available for querying where the change was initiated and then taking further actions via python script.\n\nThis workflow is useful for binding multiple inputs to a parameter. For example, one input channel might be coming from a [[MIDI]] input device, and another channel coming from an [[OSC]] input device, and you want them both to control a given parameter. The Bind CHOP's output channel which is bound to the parameter will update to stay in sync with the most recent change from either of the inputs or the parameter.

See [[BlackTrax]].\n\nThe BlackTrax CHOP works in conjunction with the BlackTrax system. BlackTrax tracks up to 85 BlackTrax Beacons and sends \ndata regarding their position, rotation, velocity, and acceleration to TouchDesigner inside [https://rttrp.github.io/RTTrP-Wiki/RTTrPM.html RTTrPM Packets]. Each Beacon can have up to 3 LEDs attached, which can also be independently tracked in TouchDesigner. Each Beacon will have an ID that is specified in BlackTrax software and that Beacon ID must be mapped correctly to CHOP channels in TouchDesigner using the Mapping Table. Alternatively if the IDs are incremental then the \"From Max Beacons\" option in \"Output Format\" can be used.\n\n=== Server Settings ===\t\t\t\nThe server software should be set to send data in the WYSIWYG coordinate system (which should be the default). Rotations should be sent in Euler angles, not Quaternions. TouchDesigner should support both endian settings, but it's best to leave those as their default values.\t\n\nSee also [[BlackTrax]], [[PosiStageNet CHOP]]",

It reads clip CHOP paths from a specified DAT list which can be dynamically scripted. The Clip Blender plays clips from the list DAT; each time it reads a clip, it pop's the item off the list, and when the next clip plays through it will continue playing and popping clips off the list until it is empty. Once the list is empty the last animation in the sequence is looped. \n    \nAnimation clips will typically come from an FBX or USD asset but can also be read using the Houdini bclip format or raw chan format. Animation clips found in FBX assets must be extracted from the asset hierarchy and then loaded speerately into a [[Clip CHOP]]. All [[Clip CHOP]]'s loaded into the same clipblender must have the same number of channels, all channel names must match and the all clips must be the same sample rate.  If any of these 3 important requirements are not met, there will likely be animation glitches.\n\t\t\t\nUse the [[Info CHOP]] and [[Info DAT]] to extract information about its current state.

An option selects whether to delete or retain the matched channels.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor deleting individual samples (i.e. no channels are deleted), on the Samples page you can delete, for example, only the samples whose value is below 0, which will shorten the length of the CHOP. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn CHOPs with two or more channels, one or more \"compare\" channels are used to determine which samples are to be deleted. By default it uses the first channel to compare against. Deleting a sample at a certain index deletes a value for all the channels. If there are 4 channels, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>alpha</code> and you specify <code>alpha</code> as the \"compare\" channel, you can delete all the samples with an <code>alpha</code> of <code>0</code>. If a CHOP is 3 channels with an X,Y,Z position, you can delete all samples where the XYZ length is below a threshold.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThis is useful, for example, for thinning your data before sending a CHOP to a Geometry component for instancing. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhen all the samples are deleted, the CHOP will keep one sample for all channels and will have a <code>length</code> of one sample.

The EtherDream CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to an [http://ether-dream.com/ EtherDream] device via a network connection. The EtherDream device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the EtherDream CHOP. Applications of the EtherDream CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.\t\n\t\t\nThe EtherDream CHOP needs the IP address of the EtherDream device, which you can get from the output of an [[EtherDream DAT]].\t\t\n\t\t\nBlanking (all-off) occurs when the incoming RGB CHOP channels are all zero, or the Red Scale, Green Scale, and Blue Scale parameters are all zero.\t\t\n\t\t\nIt is sometimes helpful to have additional information with respect to the general state of the hardware, whether any warnings are generated by the connected devices, how well the EtherDream is receiving points, the point output rate, and the point buffer capacity. Such details can be seen by connecting the EtherDream CHOP to an [[Info CHOP]], and may be useful for troubleshooting display images.\t\t\n\t\t\nThe <code>maxrate</code> column of the EtherDream DAT indicates the maximum number of samples per second that can be sent to the EtherDream device, though in practice, most lasers are reflected into position by a set of mechanical reflectors, with their own mechanical characteristics.  As a result, attempting to quickly scan a square over a large area too quickly, for example, may result in a very curved corners as the physical components lag behind their target positions.\t\t\n\t\t\nLarge changes in RGB values from sample-to-sample will likely be visibly correct as lasers generally can switch on-off quickly.\t\t\n\t\t\nThe range of X and Y is typically -1 to +1, and the range of RGB is typically 0 to 1.\t\t\n\t\t\nIf <code>maxrate</code> is 100,000, and given that the CHOP takes time-sliced data, it is appropriate to send a time-sliced CHOP with a sample rate of up to 100,000 samples per second to the EtherDream CHOP.\t\t\n\t\t\nSee also: [[EtherDream DAT]], [[Laser CHOP]], and the [[Pattern CHOP]], [[Helios DAC CHOP]].",

It can be seen as a simple particle system designed for MIDI keyboards.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Event CHOP generates one sample for each off-to-on event in the input channels, which would often come from a [[MIDI In CHOP]], [[MIDI In Map CHOP]], [[Keyboard In CHOP]], or python events sent to the Event CHOP. The sample exists for the duration of the event's attack+decay+sustain+release time.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''NOTE''': See the examples in Help->[[OP Snippets]]\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Event CHOP can used to follow a polyphonic music keyboard with MIDI velocity, and can generate generating one object, polygon or geometry instance for each event. It assures the object, polygon or instance exists until the event ends after an attack-decay-sustain-release phase. The Event CHOP is often fed through other OPs to the Instance parameters of a Geometry component.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Event CHOP outputs up to 8 channels, with one sample generated per off-to-on event that is active. The sample is active until the attack-decay-sustain-release is over, at which moment the sample disappears (like particle death).\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWatch the channel graph of the Event CHOP to understand what it is doing. It can be sent to a [[Limit SOP]] or a [[CHOP to SOP|Channel SOP]] to place geometry for each event. You can send event information to the SOP via the Event CHOP channels that get transformed into geometry channels like <code>tx</code>, <code>ty</code>, <code>scale</code>, texture v (giving movie time offsets), alpha, r, g and b colors.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOn a MIDI keyboard, you can trigger many events simultaneously, and, like particles, you may want to launch objects that remain in existence the next time you press the same key.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Event CHOP is designed to handle this. It creates one sample every time you press any key, and that sample lives for any length of time. This CHOP is lightweight - the minimum number of channels and samples are created, even with 88-key MIDI keyboards and lots of pounding on the keyboard.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThere are channels that represent age, note number and MIDI velocity when you pressed the key, as well as a flag telling if the key has since been released.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nEach event has a unique ID, held in the <code>id</code> channel that can be used to generate random XY displacements of each note, for example.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nA movie index is set by the <code>state</code> channel which rises from 0 to 1 and loops between 1 to 2 continuously until the note goes into its release state at which time it goes from 2 to 3. So for a bird cycle, you use the 0 to 1 state for the jump phase, 1 to 2 for the flappin in flight phase, and 2 to 3 for the landing phase.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Event CHOP's 1st input is for event triggers.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe 2nd input resets the triggers.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe 3rd input is optional and allows for sampling values for each event.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[Timer CHOP]], [[Count CHOP]], [[Speed CHOP]], [[Trigger CHOP]]",

Download the mesh conversion tool ''ConvertSurreyFaceModel.exe'' from the [https://github.com/NVIDIA/BROADCAST-AR-SDK/tree/master/tools Nvidia AR SDK page on GitHub]\n\n3. Run the conversion tool to generate the nvf file.

Some functions take two parameters, and these require the use of the second input. The first parameter, X, is always a value from a channel in the first input. The second parameter, Y, is a value from a corresponding channel in the second input. Channels from each input are paired by name or index.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSince many of these functions can produce math errors, an error handling tab is provided for error handling and recovery. \t\t\t\nErrors can be handled by replacing the bad sample with a pre-defined value or by using the value of the previous sample. Alternatively, cooking can be aborted upon error for debugging networks.\t\n\nFunction types in decibels: as you would employ for audio or other signal strengths. -10dB means 1/10 the power, -20dB means 1/100 the power. It turns out that each 3dB means almost exactly double the power, so +12dB is 2*2*2*2 = 16 times the power. Power is proportional to the square of the amplitude.

See the Snippet for Blob Track.\n\nAll of a computer's available serial ports can be found in the Device Manager under the Windows operating system. Their names begin with 'COM'. Example: COM1, COM2, COM3, etc.\n\nThe Hokuyo CHOP outputs the measurement data from the laser scan in meters, either in Polar or Cartesian Coordinates. The laser scan is done counter clockwise over N degrees (defined by the device, eg. URG-04LX-UG01 is 240 degrees, UST-10LX is 270 degrees) and returns the distance to the first object hit by the laser at that point. \n\nThe Hokuyo laser scanners have an angular resolution that specifies the number of data points returned from a full scan. For the URG-04LX-UG01 there is a data point every ~0.3515 degrees, so over a 240 degree scan there is a total of 682 data points. For the UST-10LX there is a data point every 0.25 degrees, so over a 270 degree scan there is a total of 1080 data points. The Hokuyo laser scanners also have a start and end step that define a total detection range. \n\nThe UST-10LX has the same measurement parameters as the UTM-30LX in the chart below. The UST-20LX ethernet model will also work like the UST-10LX.\n\nFor a visualization of the scan and a table of device specific numbers, see the image below:\n\n[[image:scan_info.jpg]]\n\nIf the Hokuyo device is an ethernet model like the UTM-30LX-EW, make sure Window Firewall is not blocking it. Each install of TD will need to be allowed through the firewall separately. This commonly catches people out with networking OPs, as sometimes the Windows \u201callow TD to network\u201d dialog doesn\u2019t open on first connection attempt. A quick disabling of the firewall will let you test this theory.\n\nSee also [[Serial DAT]], [[serialDAT_Class]], [[Arduino]]",

This parameter also accepts patterns and wildcards. Example: <code>null[1-5] null17 null4</code>. You can also specify bones in this group as well.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe CHOP will then create a set of rotate and bone-length channels for each bone. Additionally, the CHOP will also output 3 translate channels for the first bone in the chain. It will also setup the export links automatically, so you just have to turn on the export flag for this CHOP.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe way the CHOP solves this system is by creating a guide curve between the supplied Guide objects. Use the Interpolation and Order parameters to define what type of curve it will use. By default, the control vertices of the curve will be the centroids of the object. The curve is also given orientation, by adopting the orientation of each guide object. The bones line up their X axes with this orientation.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can view this curve by using the [[Inverse Curve SOP]]. Just supply it with the name of the Inverse Curve CHOP and it will extract the geometry for viewing/debugging purposes. It actually will contain 3 curves (the original guide, and the guide displaced in +X and +Y). These curves can be skinned with a [[Skin SOP]] for better feedback, etc.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe span parameters can be used to trim out the beginning and end of the guide curve if so needed.\u00a0For example Span 0.3 0.7 will lay the bones along the middle 40% of the curve.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the rare case that the user has setup a curve with all the X axes\u00a0(twists) pointing along the same direction of the curve, then the Up Vector parameter is used to break the tie, so to speak.

The TOP will automatically assign any bodies that are discovered by the device to the available player spaces. Due to the system used to detect player skeletons from the depth camera image, body tracking data can lag multiple frames behind the image data. To more closely synchronize body and image data, use the 'Sync Body Tracking To Image' option on the primary [[Kinect Azure TOP]] that is controlling the device (synchronization will increase lag in the image capture).\n\nFor a diagram of the joints tracked and their hierarchy, visit [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-joints Microsoft's Kinect Azure SDK].\n\nAcceleration and rotation data from the camera's IMU sensor can be obtained by enabling the 'IMU Channels' parameter.\n\nSee also [[Kinect Azure TOP]], [[Kinect Azure Select TOP]].",

Currently only 1 Leap Motion device can be connected at a time.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nTo connect with the device you will need to install the Leap Motion software which is available here:\t\nhttps://developer.leapmotion.com/releases\n* API Version 5 Gemini - Download Gemini v5.6.1\n* API Version 4 Orion - Download Orion Beta v4.1.0\n* API Version 2 Tracking - Download Orion Beta v3.2.1\n\nYou will also need to set the Library Folder parameter to the location of the Leap SDK on your machine. See the parameter details below for more information.\n\n'''Tip:''' If using Gemini V5, the Leap Motion will only work in one orientation. By default the hands enter from the bottom of the camera view, though this can be changed in setting to invert the direction. This is an important distinction between Gemini V5 and the older V2/V4 APIs which could work in either orientation.\n\n'''Note:''' TouchDesigner does not include a license to use the Leap Motion hardware or software. Make sure to check with the [https://www.ultraleap.com/ UltraLeap website] regarding any applicable licenses that you may need for your project.\n\nSee also [[Leap Motion]], [[Leap Motion TOP]]",

It synthesizes curves using a choice of common waveforms like Sine or Pulse, or it repeats a prepared incoming curve.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Frequency parameter and the Octave Control input. To watch its behavior, attach a Trail CHOP to its output and alter the Frequency parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUp to three input CHOPs can be connected to the LFO CHOP:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Octave Control''' - Without this first (optional) input, the frequency is simply the Frequency parameter. If this input is connected, every unit doubles the frequency: When Octave Control is 1, the frequency is double, when it is 2 it is 4x, when it is -1 the frequency is half the Frequency parameter and when it is 0, there is no change in the frequency.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Reset''' - The seond (optional) input contains on-off (<=0 or >0) that restarts the channels of the oscillator from the beginning of the wave. The reset depends on the setting of the Reset Condition menu. By default, when the Reset input goes from off to on, it resets the wave and starts the waveform immediately. If Reset Condition is set to \"While On\", the reset value will be held until the Reset input goes off. Reset means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform\".\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Source Wave''' - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a multi-sample CHOP curve and can contain any number of channels, limited to the channels defined on the Channel page. The waveform Type parameter is disabled.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe LFO CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you alter the Frequency, you can control the time warp.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nUnlike the [[Wave CHOP]], this is a time-sliced CHOP, that is, it generates its waveform as it goes, and speeds/slows how it steps through the waveform Type while the Frequency changes.  Unlike the [[Audio Oscillator CHOP]], the LFO CHOP is designed for non-audio frequencies. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[Audio Oscillator CHOP]], [[Wave CHOP]], [[Pulse CHOP]].",

Also, any number of MIDI CHOPs can read from the same or different sources. TouchDesigner can be configured such that MIDI Start, Stop, or Continue events can control the [[Timeline]] and [[Beat Dialog]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe 'Simplified Output' option creates a channel for every type of MIDI event received, so number of channels expands while the devices is being used. No need to specify name, channel and index patterns.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Note''': The values of the MIDI inputs are saved into the TouchDesigner .toe file, and are restored when the file is reloaded. The physical controllers may be in a different position when the .toe is restarted, causing the values to jump when the controllers are moved.

        "long": "The MIDI Out CHOP sends [[MIDI]] events to any available MIDI devices when its input channels change. More flexibly, the Python [[midioutCHOP Class]] can be used to send any type of MIDI event to a MIDI device via an existing MIDI Out CHOP. In [[Tscript]], the <code>midi</code> command can output MIDI events.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe MIDI devices can be other software programs (such as midisynth) or devices attached to the serial ports. Channels are used to control the sending of the MIDI events. The channels are evaluated over the last time slice (from the last [[Timeline]] position to the current).\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events based on any changes to its input channels. The channels have to be named appropriately, like <code>ch3c14</code> and <code>ch7n60</code>.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nAn event is sent every time a channel changes its value during this slice. All timing is preserved, as long as the [[Timeline]] is running in realtime (the \"Realtime\" flag is in the top menu bar). \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nNaming the CHOP channels: Channels are mapped to events by their name. Events like notes, controllers and velocities must be followed by the note/controller number (n65, c7). If the number is left off a note event, the note number is the value of the channel. Other events, which are sent to the entire channel, do not need a trailing number (pc, pw). The channel prefix can be used to identify the MIDI channel the event should be sent on (i.e. \"ch1n45\" assigns that TouchDesigner channel to note 45 messages on MIDI channel 1).  Channels can always be renamed with a [[Rename CHOP]] before entering the [[MIDI Out CHOP]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI velocity as well. The values of the channels entering the MIDI Out CHOPs are sent as the velocity of the note. If Normalize is \"None\", the channel needs to be 0 to 127. If Normalize is \"0 to 1\", channel values between 0 and 1 are scaled to be MIDI 0 to 127.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe \"Cook Every Frame\" option cooks the CHOP every frame, even if the CHOP isn't being displayed. All Volume Off and All Volume On flags are new and emit events for Controller 7 of all 16 channels. MIDI output go in a separate thread to allow output that slows TouchDesigner less. It now works in Time Slice mode for note events and controller events. (Not for Program Change or Sysex messages yet) Note channels only trigger anew Note On when the input channel goes from 0 or less to a value greater than zero. Similar for Note Off events.The channel name determines how it is interpreted.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor example,\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n: ch3n60 - this channel is interpreted as channel3 note 60. A Note On event is sent when the value goes from 0 or less to greater than zero\t\t\t\n: ch5n - This channel will contain note numbers.\u00ac\u2020 The value quantized to an integer, and when the integer value changes, the note of the old value goes off and the note of the new value goes on. If the channel steps from 53 to 78, it sends a Note Off event for note 53, and a Note On event for note 78.\t\t\t\n: ch14c7 - the value of the channel is sent to controller 7 (volume) of channel 14. By default, the values 0 to 1 are mapped to MIDI value 0 to 127.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThese features work in Time Slice mode:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n: By default, channels are to start with \"ch\" followed by the channel number (1-16). In the case of notes, it is followed by \"n\" for notes, then digits for the note number. In the case of controllers, it is followed by \"c\" and a controller number. These prefixes can be altered. MIDI Out now interprets aftertouch, pressure, pitchwheel channels, and outputs these events to the MIDI stream. Note-normalization is added allowing 0 to 127 and 0 to 1 ranges. MIDI Out reads a bar ramp channel to output MIDI clock events\u00ac\u2020 (with a channel popup menu to the parameter to select the channel name). Program change events are implemented through the \"pc\" channels.both 7 and 14 bit controller events can be output. You can capture a MIDI stream and output it to a file.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also the [[MIDI In DAT]], [[MIDI Event DAT]], [[MIDI In Map CHOP]], [[MIDI In CHOP]], <code>midi</code> command.",

To help decrease latency, prediction can be used to guess what the orientation will be at some point in the future.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe raw sensor data is also available, with options for both sensor acceleration and angular velocity.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe devices calibration parameters are another option. These can be used to generate the projection matrices and distortion shaders, although both of these are already available (see below and [[Oculus Rift TOP]]). This data is constant, but may differ on future devices.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe last two things the Oculus Rift CHOP can output are the left and right eye projection matrices. These can be (and will need to be) passed into a camera's \"Custom Projection\" parameter in order to provide a proper 3D experience with the Oculus Rift. For convenience, the channels are aligned to be passed in directly by reference.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWithout an Oculus Rift device connected the CHOP uses default values and will output channels corresponding to the Oculus Rift Developer Kit device.

        "long": "The Phaser CHOP does staggered (time-offset) animation interpolation. Phaser outputs one channel with multi-samples. Each sample animates from 0 to 1 over a cycle, but each sample value rises from 0 and arrives at 1 at different times.\n    \nFor example, you may have a set of N objects that you want to animate from a start position to an end position. You set Num Samples to N, which will make the Phaser CHOP output one channel with N samples that will animate the samples from 0 to 1 and be interpolated with an easing function. In the Phaser CHOP the start-to-end cycle is controlled by the first input of the CHOP, which is expected to be one channel with value between 0 to 1. \n\nThe 0-1 values can be used with the [[Lookup CHOP]] to animate groups of channels.\n\nBy default the timing is staggered uniformly.  If you want to stagger their transitions irregularly, you use the second input, a set of values in one CHOP channel (typically N samples) that are between 0 and 1. The phase value specifies the object's timing relationship with the rest of those in the CHOP. A phase value of 1 corresponds to an animated object thats \"ahead of the pack\" (ie. it will start animating before the others). A value of 0 corresponds to an object that is late (ie. it will be the last to start easing/animating). If a phase input is not provided then the phase will simply be i/N where N is the total number of objects (ie. samples), and i is the index of the current sample.\n    \nThere is also a notion of an \"Edge\" in the Phaser, which describes the cohesiveness of the group of animated objects and how fast the samples rise. A small value will cause the objects to go through the animation very quickly or at high value, very slowly and in unison with other samples.\n\nLook at David Braun's '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PQW4f34c8 TouchDesigner Summit Talk]''' to see the background of the Phaser CHOP. Its functionality draws heavily from David's research and development in quantitative easing. \n\nSee also the [[OP Snippets]].",

Installing their SDK is required to setup the license file. After installation of the SDK, the license can be setup with the <code>post_installation.bat</code> script in the <code>C:/Program Files/Cubemos/SkeletonTracking/scripts</code> folder. A model file (<code>.cubemos</code>) is also required for the skeleton tracking, two of which are packaged with the Cubemos Skeleton Tracking SDK, located in their <code>Cubemos/SkeletonTracking/models/skeleton-tracking</code> folder.\n\n'''NOTE:''' The [https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases librealsense SDK v2.50.0] does not look like it will be updated for Apple Silicon, so it is not an option to add to these builds.\n\nSee also: [[RealSense]], [[RealSense TOP]]",

For example, the Speed CHOP converts rotation rate (rotations per second) into the number of rotation turns. ( Math-heads recognize this as an 'integral', which calculates the area under a curve. The curve is the incoming channel values over a time range, the output is the area.)\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you send a Constant CHOP channel that has value 1 into the Speed CHOP, then the Speed CHOP output will increase by 1 every second. If you feed it -2, it will decrease by 2 every second, and if you feed it 0, the output will not change. Use a Trail CHOP to see its results. You can reset the Speed CHOP to 0 by pressing the Reset parameter, or by sending in a channel (whose value is greater than 0) into the second input.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe first input contains the channels to be 'integrated'. By default, the Speed CHOP is time-sliced, so it keeps adding/subtracting to the output each frame it cooks. If you turn off its Time Slice parameter and send it a CHOP with a fixed frame range (like a default Noise CHOP), you can see the cumulative value starting from 0.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe output is calculated by adding the input's channel values for every sample, divided by the [[CHOP#Parts_of_a_CHOP|samples per second]] of the Speed CHOP (typically 60), starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative input values reduce the output, positive values increase it. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhen the CHOP is reset, its output can be set to any value via the <span class=\"tipTextCHOP\">Reset Value</span> parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhen the second input is used to reset the output, where the second input is greater than 0, the area is reset and held to the reset value. For example, a [[Wave CHOP]] (which is negative half the time) when passed into the second input causes the output to be reset for half a cycle.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[Lookup CHOP]], [[Timer CHOP]], [[Count CHOP]], [[Event CHOP]]",

When the distance (output - input) is zero, there is no force and therefore no movement.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nAlternately, when Input Effect is force, the input is used as a force on the spring/mass, and the CHOP reacts to this force plus the force of the spring/mass.

        "long": "The Timer CHOP is an engine for running timed processes. It outputs channels such as timing fractions, counters, pulses and timer states, and it calls python functions (callbacks) when various timing events occur.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nExamples using the Timer CHOP include triggering multiple timed cues, running playlists, timelines, state machines, and driving pre-animated animation components in 3D scenes. See Help -> Operator Snippets for numerous examples.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou set a timer to a number of seconds, frames or samples, and trigger it to start via the Start parameter or the second input CHOP. The Timer CHOP outputs in seconds, frames, samples, fraction and on-off states as it\u2019s counting, including a <code>done</code> channel that goes on when it is complete.  When it reaches certain states like end-of-cycles or when it\u2019s done, various python callbacks are called allowing you to customize its behavior.\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\nThe Timer CHOP gets triggered by events (via pulsing its parameters or driving its two inputs). It takes events in, counts time, changes state. Via its python callback functions, you can send events out to other nodes, set parameters, get/set values in DATs, CHOPs and storage, restart itself, or trigger other nodes. As such, it can operate as a state machine.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt has play/pause, plus a speed control to slow down or speed up the timer.\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\nIt can also cycle indefinitely and then can be signaled to end immediately or at the end of the current cycle.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOne Timer CHOP can also have multiple timers within it. By attaching a Table DAT you can define one timer (segment) per row. In Serial Timers mode it allows for one time segment followed by another. In Parallel Timers mode, the timers all run in parallel, each with its own begin time and length, and its own set of output channels.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n[[image:Timer CHOP.2.png]]\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Timer CHOP can be Locked to Timeline in a deterministic way, or run more freely in Sequential Mode. When run independently from the timeline, you can jump ahead, break out of cycles, pause, <code>goTo()</code> exact position or timecode in the timer, and dynamically adjust the speed.\n\nThe Timer CHOPs can be chained together, so that when one ends, the next can begin. They just need to all be Initialized together, where the <code>ready_pulse</code> channel of one Timer CHOP is exported to the Initialize parameter of the next Timer CHOP. Then they can be run in sequence, where the output of one Timer CHOP\u2019s <code>done_pulse</code> channel is wired to the Start input (or exported to the Start parameter) of the next Timer CHOP.  You start the chain of timers by starting the first Timer CHOP. By using some Timer CHOPs to loop awaiting input or response, or by adding logic to decide which CHOP to start next, state machines can be implemented.\t\t\t\n\nAttach an Info DAT to see the timecodes, or use the <code>.timecode</code> members. Custom text strings can be placed in the Info DAT for each segment, and custom animated channels can be created.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nTo make the entire CHOP loop after the last segment, set the On Done menu to Re-Start.\t\n\n'''Recommended''': the '''OP Snippets for Timer CHOP'''.  See the channel descriptions in [[Initialize Start]].\t\t\n\t\t\t\n===Callbacks===\nThe callbacks are called at different moments during the timer progression.\n\n<code>onInitialize()</code> gets called when you pulse the Initialize parameter. Here you can prepare any part of your setup prior to starting. At the end of Initialize the timer goes into a \"ready\" state.\n\n<code>onStart()</code> gets called on the frame that the Start parameter is pulsed. The timer then goes into a \"running\" state.\n\n<code>onTimerActive()</code> gets called every frame that the timer is running and there is no Delay or Play is off.\n\n<code>onCycleStart()</code> gets called if the timer is set to cycle via the Cycle parameters.\n\t\t\t\nBefore a cycle or segment ends, an <code>onCycleEndAlert()</code> callback based on the Cycle End Alert parameter can be called to allow you to prepare for the next cycle, segment or Timer CHOP.\n\n<code>onSegmentEnter()</code> and <code>onSegmentExit()</code> get called if the timer is being driven by a Segments DAT which acts like several timers in one.  The argument <code>segment</code> in these callbacks is actually an object with useful members including any custom columns you have in your segment table: In <code>onSegmentEnter()</code>, put the code <code>print(help(segment))</code>\n\n<code>onDone()</code> gets called when the timer reaches its finished state.\n\nYou can initialize at a specific time by using <code>.masterSeconds</code> in <code>onInitialize()</code>.\n\t\t\t\n'''See also''': [[Trigger CHOP]], [[Event CHOP]], [[Speed CHOP]], [[Count CHOP]], [[Beat CHOP]], [[Event CHOP]], [[Clock CHOP]], [[Delay CHOP]], [[CHOP Execute DAT]], [[LFO CHOP]]. \t\ntime measurements\n{{{!}} class=\"wikitable\"\n{{!}}+ Time Measurements and what affects them\n{{!}}-\n!

        "long": "The Transform CHOP takes transformations in various formats, applied operations to them, and outputs them in various formats. It can be used to:\t\t\n\t\t\t\n* Change the position and orientation of an object.\t\t\t\n* Convertion transforms one format to another format.\n* Convert a set of transform channels with a certain transform order into an equivalent set of channels with a different transform order.\t\n* Change the direction, starting point and scale of motion capture data or other data being calibrated to match other reference frames.\t\t\t\n\t\n( See also the [[Transform XYZ CHOP]] for fdoing transforms on XYZ positions and vectors. )\n\nThree transform formats exists:\n* Transform with Euler angles for rotation. These are defined by channels with suffixes: <code>tx ty tz, rx ry rz, sx sy sz</code> and an optional transform and rotate order <code>xord and rord</code>.\n* Transform with Quaternion for rotation. These are defined by channels with suffixes: <code>tx ty tz, qx qy qx qw, sx sy sz</code> and an optional transform order <code>xord</code>.\n* A 4x4 or 3x3 matrix. These are defined by channels with suffixes: <code>m00, m10, m20, m30, m01, m11... m33</code>. Where the notation is <code>m[''row''][''col'']</code>. The matrix should be be in column-major order, that is to say, the translate portion should be in <code>m03, m13, m23</code>. The 4th row and column can be omitted to use a 3x3 matrix instead. Unlike the other formats, this format can not have arbitrary missing channels. Either 9 channels for 3x3 or 16 channels for 4x4 matrices must be provided.\n\nThe first two transform formats can be specified with missing channels, in which case default values will be used. 0s for translates and rotates, 1s for scale, and (0,0,0,1) for quaternion.\n\nFrequently the input channels come from an [[Object CHOP]] or [[Parameter CHOP]]. Examples are: \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n* geo1:tx geo1:ty geo1:tz geo1:rx ...\t\t\t\n* headtx headty headtz headrx\t\t\t\n* tx ty tz rx ... (what you would get from a Parameter CHOP)\n* cam1:m00 cam1:m10 cam1:m20 .... cam1:m33\n\t\t\t\n===Multiple Transform Sets===\nAny of the above defines a transformation matrix. Multiple transform 'sets' can be specified by channels having different prefixes. Different sets using different formats can be all in the same CHOP. Formats can not be mixed within a set though. Each set will be combined with sets from the other input, and the transform on the 'Transform' page to create final transforms for each set.\n\nIf no inputs are connected to the CHOP, it will output the transform generated from the 'Transform' page.\n\nIf inputs are connected, the output will contain the same number of samples as the first input. Samples will be combined between the inputs 1:1, that is, the start/end range and the sample rate of the inputs are ignored. If the second input contains less samples than the first one, the extend conditions for that CHOP will be used to determine values for the samples coming from the 2nd CHOP that are out of range.\n\nIf multiple sets are provided, they will be matched 1st-to-1st set, 2nd-to-2nd set. If there are less sets in the second input than the first one, then it will loop over the sets. E.g if the first input as 5 sets and the second input as 2 sets, the matching will be 1st-to-1st, 2nd-to-2nd, 3rd-to-1st, 4th-to-2nd and 5th-to-1st.\n\n===Order of Operation===\nThe inputs will be combined together first, then the result from that will be combined with the transform defined on the 'Transform' page.\n\nThe channels of a Transform CHOP are frequently exported back to objects.",

The Warp Curve acts as either a rate control or an index control, as explained below. The Warp CHOP usually works on non-time-sliced channels, like pre-key-framed channels of motion. See also the [[Lookup CHOP]], the [[Speed CHOP]] and the [[Audio Oscillator CHOP]].\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the Rate Control Method, feeding the Warp CHOP a Warp Curve with a constant value of 1 makes the output identical to the Pre-Warp Channels, assuming the two inputs have the same start-end interval. That is, where the rate is 1, the Pre-Warp Channels are not warped.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhere the Warp Curve is above 1, it causes a speed-up in the animation. Where the Warp Curve is below 1, it causes a slow-down in the animation. Rates less than 0 cause the animation to go in reverse.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the Index Control Method, the Warp Curve acts as an index into the first input. If the Warp Curve is a straight ramp with a slope of 1 (in Units), it produces unwarped output channels. If Units is set to Seconds, a Warp Curve value of 0 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 0 seconds. A Warp Curve value of 2 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 2 seconds.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Warp CHOP will output the same number of channels and channel names as the Pre-Warp Channels input, and the sample rate will be the same as that of the Pre-Warp input. However, the CHOP will output the same start-end time interval as the Warp Curve input.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf you take a Warp Curve and pass it directly to a Warp CHOP with the Rate Control Method, it is equivalent to passing the same curve to an Speed CHOP and then passing it to the Warp CHOP with the Index Control Method.",

You can adjust period (frequency), phase, shape, amplitude and offset.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Wave CHOP gives a set of waves in channels of a specifiable time-range. It is superceded by the [[LFO CHOP]] which gives an endless stream of waves that is [[Time Slice]]d, and the [[Pattern CHOP]] that has more control over shaping waveform samples (and is time-independent). The [[Audio Oscillator CHOP]] also creates waveforms that are continually repeated, but its defaults are for higher-frequency waves at higher (audio) sample rates. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nBecause the Extend Conditions of the Wave CHOP are set to Repeat, the wave will repeat outside the 10-second range.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nApplied to the actual waveform can be an offset, decay and ramp.\n\t\t\t\nMultiple channels can be generated in the Channel Name parameter using [[Pattern Expansion]]. A few examples of name pattern name expansion:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n* <code>tx ty tz</code>\t\t\t\n* <code>t[xyz]</code> - expands to <code>tx ty tz</code>\t\t\t\n* <code>chan[1-4]</code> - expands to <code>chan1 chan2 chan3 chan4</code>\t\t\t\n* <code>c[xyz][1-5:2]</code> - expands to <code>cx1 cx3 cx5 cy1 cy3 cy5 cz1 cz3 cz5</code>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[LFO CHOP]], [[Pattern CHOP]], [[Audio Oscillator CHOP]].",

Multiple people can be tracked at the same time with low-latency, and the system compatible with all cameras and video feeds. TouchDesigner used the wrnchAI Edge SDK and all computation is done locally in realtime utilizing Nvidia GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA\u00ae Deep Neural Network library ([https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn cuDNN]). This can offer skeletal tracking of multiple people at 60fps or higher (90-120fps etc).\n    \n '''Requires a separate license from wrnchAI''' to run in TouchDesigner.

An extruded letter with no back polygons output is also unacceptable (even with backs output it can be unacceptable because of the second requirement).\t\t\n* All polygons must be convex and coplanar. In the case of the Extrude SOP, you must select Output Convex Faces for front and back faces. It will now be a usable input for Boolean. The Divide SOP also offers a convexing function for geometry not created with the Extrude SOP.\t\t\n\t\t\nOther caveats for Boolean are the following:\t\t\n\t\t\n* Point colors and texture UV coordinates are not interpolated correctly.\t\t\n* In some cases polygons can be reversed so that all normals point outwards. The polygon reversal should not usually present much of a problem (use a Primitive SOP &gt; Face/Hull page &gt; Vertex &gt; Reverse to reverse them if necessary).\t\t\n\n* A [[Facet SOP]] can be used to prepare inputs when the Boolean SOP complaints they are not closed.

This makes it complementary to the [[SOP to CHOP]]. The Channels created by the [[SOP to CHOP]] can be modified and then re-inserted into the SOP network via a CHOP to SOP.\t\n\t\t\nBy default, the SOP is a line from (<code>-1 0 0</code>) to (<code>1 0 0</code>) containing one point for every sample in the CHOP.\t\t\n \t\t\nIt matches the input channels to the Channel Scope (<code>tx ty tz</code>) where possible. If <code>tx</code> or <code>ty</code> or <code>tz</code> don\u2019t match anything, it just uses the value from the default line, and it only shows a Warning.\t\t\n\t\t\nThe simplest thing to do is to send it a channel named <code>ty</code>, which will make a 3D curve that looks like the CHOP curve.\t\t\n\t\t\nThis does what a [[Point SOP]] with a <code>op('wave1')['chan1'].eval(0)</code> function can do, but is much faster.\t\t\n\t\t\nBy using point groups from the incoming SOP, the channels can be inserted only into the group's points.\t\t\n\t\t\nThe CHOP to SOP also supports custom attributes. If the user maps a channel to an attribute that is not found, that attribute is added to the points.  Currently, all custom attributes are floats and of size = 1. \t\t\n\t\t\nIn its default state it will attempt to replace the point positions (<code>P(0) P(1) P(2)</code>) with the channels named <code>tx ty</code> and <code>tz</code>.\t\t\n\t\t\nThe channel and attribute scope are first expanded into individual names and matched on a 1 to 1 basis. If you are filling P it doesn't matter if you specify <code>t[xyz]</code> or <code>tx ty tz</code>, both will replace <code>P(0) P(1) P(2)</code>, which can be collapsed to <code>P</code>.\t\t\n\t\t\nFor example: Add custom attributes \"Scale\", \"Twist\" or \"Roll\" to the backbone's points with a CHOP to SOP.\t\t\n\t\t\nIf you connect a SOP to its input, it will use the SOP as a starting geometry versus the default line.",

As opposed to the Point SOP or other SOPs that manipulate control points (CVs), the Clay SOP operates on the primitive contours themselves, providing a direct, intuitive, and unconstrained way of reshaping geometry. Thus, rather than translating CVs to change the aspect of the primitive, the Clay SOP takes the inverse approach of manipulating the primitive's skin to reposition the CVs.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe point that defines the area to be modified is called a \"target point\" or \"target\" for short. It is expressed as a (u,v) pair in the parametric space of the primitive and ranges between 0 and 1 in both U and V. The image of the target point on the primitive is a 3D point which Clay can displace in several ways. Furthermore, if the primitive is a surface, there is are options to pull only the point or a whole isoparametric curve in either U or V.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nClay does not refine the faces and surfaces unless asked to, so the complexity of the geometry does not increase. The area affected by the change varies with each primitive type and topology. In all cases it is possible to reduce to amount of change by inserting a Refine SOP before the Clay SOP and inserting detail around the target point. For other ways to increase the locality of the deformation as well as its sharpness, see U and V Sharpness below.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIf a second input is present, it is possible to snap the target (u,v) point to an (s,t) point on the first primitive of the second input. Without a second input, the primitives can be made to snap to themselves. Moreover, the Clay SOP is able to snap the target to arbitrary points in space.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nBoth this SOP and the Align SOP can be used effectively as snapping tools and building blocks for curve networks. The main difference between the two SOPs is that Clay deforms the inputs partially, while Align translates and/or rotates the whole primitive.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Clay SOP accepts a mix of any combination of face and surface types.",

The ease of developing C++ code for either of these two options are fairly similar. Nevertheless, by setting the \u201c<code>directToGPU</code>\u201d flag within the C++ code, only one of these modes is recognized as a valid mode. Different classes are dedicated for each of these two modes, so bear in mind that setting the \u201c<code>directToGPU</code>\u201d flag to \u201c<code>true</code>\u201d or \u201c<code>false</code>\u201d requires different classes and functions to be called within either of <code>execute()</code> or <code>executeVBO()</code>.\n\nIn CPU mode, the geometry data can be added one at a time or all at once. As well, in CPU mode the CPlusPlus SOP can use wired SOP inputs and SOP to DAT, SOP to CHOP, or SOP output OPs as well. Additionally DAT, CHOP, and TOP 'non-wired' input operators can be used as custom parameters. In this case, the custom parameters must be first handled in the C++ code to be able to accept any input from the other operators. \n\nThe GPU direct mode is similar to CPU mode, but it cannot use any output SOPs downstream or be accessed by SOP to DAT or SOP to CHOP operators. In GPU direct mode the data is added to the VBO buffers immediately which improves the performance through faster updating, however the size of the vertices and face array indices must be known prior to filling the buffers. \n\nExample for CPlusPlus SOP as a Visual Studio project in Windows are available in <code>C:/Program Files/Derivative/TouchDesigner/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP</code> or your custom TouchDesigner installation folder. (NOTE: On macOS it is here: <code>TouchDesigner.app/Contents/Resources/tfs/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP</code>)\n\n'''Custom Parameters''' - Custom Parameters can be automatically created by the C++ SOP <code>.dll</code>. This custom parameter page can be removed, edited, or appended to from within the <code>setupParameters()</code> function in SimpleShapes.cpp. The defined custom parameters can be enabled or disabled depending on whether they are valid for a specific task or not. \n\n'''Geometry Data''' - Geometry within the C++ SOP code can be defined by any algorithm or even imported from external files. The possible geometries are triangular meshes and particle systems. Note that if your original geometry has polygons with more than 3 vertices, they must be converted to triangles with known and valid vertex indices, before being added to the list of triangles.\n\nThe geometry data for exporting to TouchDesigner can have point, normal, and texture coordinates, RGBA colors, triangle information in case of meshes and/or particle systems, as well as custom attributes with an arbitrary name, float or integer type, and up to 4 components (ie. Cd0, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3).",

In the case of planar or open polygons, the normal is difficult to determine, and may not always provide the result that you expect. Turn on the Primitive Normals display in the [[Viewer]] display options to see the normals.\n\nThe extrusion is created by extending surfaces from the vertices of the input geometry along the cross-section curve given in the second input (Input 1). The first vertex of the cross-section curve is placed by default at the vertices of the input geometry and aligned so that the curve's positive Y axis extends opposite to the input geometry's normal. The cross-section's positive X axis by default extends outwards from center of the input geometry.\n\nIf no cross-section curve is given, a vertical line going from (0,0,0) to (0,1,0) is used. This results in a 1 unit extrusion directly backwards from the input geometry's normals. As another example, using a straight line from (0,0,0) to (.1,.1,0) will result in an extrusion that extends 1 unit backwards from the input and flares .1 unit outwards on all sides. The Thickness and Depth parameters can be used to shift and scale the cross-section without directly changing the curve.\n\n'''Note:''' The shape of the cross-section is always relative to its first vertex, so shifting the entire cross-section curve will have no effect. Also, only the X and Y axes of the curve are used i.e. Z position values are ignored.\n\nAfter the new geometry is created, normals are computed by default.\n\n'''Warning:''' If you take a default output from a [[Text SOP]] and Extrude it, it may have bad rendering artifacts (and too many polygons) as it's extruding each of the triangles of the triangulated letters.

The first input, called '''Geometry to Deform''', is for the geometry you wish to deform. The second input, called '''Rest Geometry''', must be an evenly spaced grid which fully encloses the geometry to deform. The third input, called '''Deformed Geometry''', is a copy of the initial grid that is altered in some way, either by moving parts of it with animation channels, dragging its points in the Model Editor, or by running it through a [[Spring SOP]] which distorts it with the forces which simulate the laws of physics. Lattice computes a deformation based on the difference between the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry, and applies it to the input geometry.

Metaballs can be thought of as spherical force fields whose surface is an implicit function defined at any point where the density of the force field equals a certain threshold. Because the density of the force field can be increased by the proximity of other metaball force fields, metaballs have the unique property that they change their shape to adapt and fuse with surrounding metaballs. This makes them very effective for modeling organic surfaces. For example, below we have a metaball. The surface of the metaball exists whenever the density of the metaball's field reaches a certain threshold:\t\n\t\t\n[[Image:MetaExample1.jpg]]\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen two or more metaball force fields are combined, as in the illustration below, the resulting density of the force fields is added, and the surface extends to include that area where the force fields intersect and create density values with a value of one. For more information on metaballs, see [[Metaball]]s.\t\t\n\t\t\n[[Image:MetaExample2.jpg]]\t\t\n{{OPSubSection\n|opFamily=SOP\n|sectionName=Level of Detail for Metaball Display\n|sectionSummary=You can change the level of detail of the metaball and NURBS display by adjusting the Level of Detail parameter in the Display Option Dialog &gt; Viewport page &gt; <span class=\"tipTextSOP\">Level of Detail</span> option. To open the Display Options Dialog, press \"p\" in a SOP viewport.\n}}\n{{OPSubSection\n|opFamily=SOP\n|sectionName=Better Metaball Shading Tip\n|sectionSummary=Accurate metaball normals will be computed if the normal attribute exists when conversion to polygons is done. Thus, to get improved shading on polygonized metaballs, it's a good idea to add the normal attribute (i.e. use a [[Facet SOP]]) before converting the metaballs.\n}}",

        "long": "The Particle SOP is used for creating and controlling motion of \"particles\" for particle systems simulations. Particle systems are often used to create simulations of natural events such as rain and snow, or effects such as fireworks and sparks. In Touch, the points of the input geometry are used as the starting positions of the particles. Each point of the input can be affected by external force (gravity) and wind. Particles can collide and bounce off another object, set by the <span class=\"tipTextSOP\">Collision Source</span>. They can also bounce off, or die at, limit planes set in X, Y and Z.\t\n    \nParticles are created with an initial velocity/direction that comes from the source geometry\u2019s point normals, and that velocity can be controlled by modifying the normals using, for instance, a [[Point SOP]], [[Facet SOP]] or [[Script SOP]]. A point with a Normal of magnitude 1 emit bear particles with a velocity of 1 unit per second in the direction of the normal. \n\t\t\t\nParticles have various [[Attribute]]s that regular geometry do not have, such as velocity, life expectancy and age. These attributes must be carried with each point in order to carry out the simulation.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe fourth input is Surface Attractors that cause the particles to be attached to areas of a surface. Each particle's id is used to determine a random target primitive, and random u,v on that primitive.  That target position is used to modify the current velocity.",

This, however, does not guarantee spatial coincidence between profile and extracted curve, and is more of an analytical tool.\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Tip:''' A profile extracted parametrically can be reapplied to the surface identically with the Project SOP by choosing the '''Parametric''' option with no Mapping to Range.

To unrefine a face or a surface you need to specify a parametric interval (not just a single value as in refinement). This allows you to unrefine primitives within arbitrary intervals, either locally or globally. For example, to unrefine the whole primitive choose 0 and 1 as the two parametric boundaries; [0,0.5] will unrefine only the first parametric half of the primitive.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe interval boundaries are given by the First/Second U/V fields. Since refinement does not need an interval, the Second U/V fields are disabled by default.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Tolerance control is only available for unrefinement, and not for refinement. Refinement does not need tolerances because it generates a curve or a surface that is mathematically identical to the original. Unrefinement, however, may tend to smooth out (or \"melt\") the original in a given area. In short, unrefinement is lossy; refinement isn't.\t\n}}",

Different face types can be skinned together into one surface. For example, it is possible to skin a cubic open NURBS curve with a polygon and a quintic closed Bzier curve even if the three faces have a different number of control vertices. Similarly, this SOP can skin the boundary curves of surfaces of different types, number of rows, columns, etc.\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen face types are input, the number of input SOPs and the number of faces in each input establish the skinning method. If only one input exists, a \"linear-skinning\" operation is performed by running a skin across the cross-sections. The result is the classic ruled or skinned surface. If a second input exists, a \"bi-linear skinning\" is performed which computes a cross-skin between the faces in the first input (U cross-sections) and the faces in the second input (V cross-sections).

It captures all the messages, where each new message changes the table it outputs. When a messages is added to the DAT, any script can be called pointing to the new message. The Multi Touch In DAT is most frequently sent to the [[Render Pick DAT]].\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt can output either of two table formats: (1) Raw Events as a FIFO (first in - first out) list, or (2) ID Table, which is the events processed into a more usable one-row-per-finger table.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Raw Events format creates a FIFO-type DAT (see also [[FIFO DAT]]) which, for each multi-touch event, has a row added to the bottom of the table while at the same time a row at the top is deleted.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nNote: To operate panel gadgets with multi-touch screens that send events through the Windows 7, 8 or 10 event stream, multi-touch works without requiring DATs. You need to use the DAT when using multiple fingers on one panel, like in a container displaying a 3D render whose objects you want to pick.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe ID table format includes the columns:\t\t\t\n* <code>id</code> - every finger press increases the id by 1\t\t\t\n* <code>sn</code> - an ongoing count of each finger press.\t\t\t\n* <code>select</code> - when 1, this row represents a finger is down.\t\t\t\n* <code>downf</code> - the absolute frame number when the finger press occurred.\t\t\t\n* <code>upf</code> - the absolute frame number that the finger press ended\t\t\t\n* <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> - the position, in pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions. <code>NOTE</code>: The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values are expressed in screen pixels, not panel width/height pixels. For example, the top-right corner of a panel will be different if the panel is scaled within another panel, window or network viewer. It is better to use <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, and scale them by the panel Width and Height.\t\t\t\n* <code>u</code>, <code>v</code> - the position, 0 to 1 in the horizontal and vertical directions\t\t\t\n* <code>downu</code>, <code>downv</code> - the position, 0 to 1 in the horizontal and vertical directions when the touch first occured (ie. initial touch down location).\t\t\t\n<code>contactx</code>, <code>contacty</code> - the width of the contact area.\t\t\t\n<code>contactu</code>, <code>contactv</code> - the height of the contact area.\t\t\t\n** <code>monitor</code> - monitor number, starting with 0\t\t\t\n* <code>clicktime</code> - like <code>downf</code>, in seconds\t\t\t\n* <code>elapsedtime</code> - the number of seconds that finger has been down.\t\t\t\n* <code>changedtime</code> - the time since the finger press that the most recent u or v value changed.\t\t\t\n* <code>dclick</code> - double-tap occurred\t\t\t\n* <code>aux</code> - user supplied data via the [[PanelCOMP_Class]] method <code>interactTouch()</code>.  When the event is triggered by the mouse via the Include Mouse option, <code>aux</code> will include the mouse buttons used (<code>1</code> for left, <code>2</code> for middle, <code>4</code> for right, can be tested bitwise).\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can use the attached callback DAT (named <code>mtouchin1_callbacks</code>) to react to multi-touch events. This is suitable for 2D interfaces that do not require a [[Render Pick DAT]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee the [[Palette:multiTouch]] example in the [[Palette]] under Tools.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also the [[MultiTouch]] page.",

        "long": "The OP Find DAT traverses the component hierarchy starting at one component and looking at all nodes within that component, and outputs a table with one row per node that matches criteria the user chooses. For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with \u201c<code>wave</code>\u201d, or all nodes with the Clone parameter set to \u201c<code>master1</code>\u201d, or all Geometry components with a tag called \u201c<code>emitter</code>\u201d.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a DAT containing certain strings.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can also cause the DAT to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nCriteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find DAT.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFurthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback DAT.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWith the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an \"or\" or \"and\" on the pattern matching criterea.  \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt also takes an optional DAT containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find DAT) which can be used to chain filters.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n=== Output Columns ===\t\t\t\nThere is a variety of columns that you can select from including <code>name</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>paths</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>tags</code>.  (<code>id</code> is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback DAT, and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback DAT. For example, you can output a custom column which is the <code>tx</code> parameter value of the node.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can control when the OP Find DAT cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active Cook menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely.  You can also click the Pulse parameter on Active Cook in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nInstead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find DAT can take an input DAT containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input DAT should contain the node \u201cid\u201d as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find DAT with the Column called \u201cID\u201d turned on.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or Clone parameter. The first OP Find DAT pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nRefer to Help -> [[OP Snippets|Operator Snippets]].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also: [[Script DAT]]",

        "long": "The Render Pick DAT lets you get information about the 3D surface at any pixel of any 3D render, allowing you to implement multi-touch on a 3D rendered scene. It samples a rendering (from a [[Render TOP]] or a [[Render Pass TOP]]) and returns 3D information from the geometry at the specified pick locations.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou feed it a DAT with minimum three columns: <code>select</code>, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>. A [[Multi Touch In DAT]] is usually connected to the Render Pick DAT, where the Multi Touch In DAT points to a container that is displaying the output of the Render TOP.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nYou can pick from multiple cameras simultaneously. You can specify a <code>camera</code> which allows the pick to occur from the point of a view other than the first camera listed in the [[Render TOP]]. The value in the column can either be a path (relative to the Render Pick DAT, or absolute) to a Camera COMP, or it can be an integer index, started at 0. If it's an index it will select the camera to use if there are multiple cameras listed in the [[Render TOP]], or if there are cameras listed in the 'Custom Pick Camera(s)' parameter. This is useful for various [[Multi-Camera Rendering]] setups, and cases such as VR where your picking isn't coming from the point of view of your eye cameras, but instead hand controllers.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe pick location is a u,v (horizontal, vertical) coordinate placed in the table that you connect to the Render Pick DAT input.  Each row of the input table represents one pick point to be sampled, except for the first row which contains column headings <code>select</code>, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> (plus any other unused columns you want).  The <code>select</code>, <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> columns are what you would get from a [[Panel CHOP]]. The u and v values goes 0 to 1 left to right and bottom to top, no matter what the aspect ratio of the render is.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWhen Strategy is Always, that u,v location is always sampled and the results are displayed in the corresponding row in the Render Pick DAT output. \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe output table will show the path of the geometry that was picked, its position (in a choice of reference frames), surface normal (excluding bump mapping), distance from camera, texture UV coordinate, color, alpha and instance id. It properly picks surfaces with deforming vertices.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThere are some examples here:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n* [[Palette:geoPanel|geoPanel]] in the palette.\t\t\t\n* [[Palette:multiTouch|multiTouch]] in the palette under Techniques.\t\t\t\n* [http://www.derivative.ca/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=166&p=13447 Render Pick DAT Example].\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also the single-sample [[Render Pick CHOP]].",

See the popup menu on the Cell Expression parameter for suggestions.\n\t\t\nClick the + below the parameters to you generate multiple sets of new cols or rows.\n\n'''Filling cells externally with python ''' - If you are not auto-filling, you can put strings into table cells using something like <code>op('table1')[2,'select'] = 'yes'</code> in a python script elsewhere, or append rows using <code>.appendRow()</code> in python. See also the [[Script DAT]] and its Snippets.\t\n\t\t\n'''Loading from external files''' - The Table DAT can also can load a table from a <code>.csv</code>, <code>.txt</code> or <code>.dat</code> file on disk or on the web. Either drag-drop the file into a network, or use the File parameter.\n\nUse <code>http://</code> when specifying a table on the internet. \n\nIf you drag the Table DAT to a desktop or folder, The DAT text will be converted into tab-delimited tables in a <code>.txt</code> file.\t\n\nSee also [[Script DAT]], [[Text DAT]].",

        "long": "'''Note''': Web DAT deprecated build 2019.15230, use [[Web Client DAT]]. \n    \n    The Web DAT fetches pages of data from a web connection. The data should be ASCII-readable. The Web DAT will automatically uncompress any gzip compressed page transfers. XML content is formatted into a readable indented structure, versus one long line normally sent by the server. An Info DAT can be used to obtain properties of the last page retrieved.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThere are two main methods of retrieving a page from a web site using the Web DAT:\t\t\t\n* Fetch\t\t\t\n* Submit and Fetch\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Fetch method simply fetches the page from the internet using the simple protocol \"GET\", while the Submit and Fetch method can be used for submitting form data to a server.  By default the latter method uses the \"POST\" protocol.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nBoth methods allow a DAT table input to specify options while fetching.  This table should consist of rows of name/value pairs.  The first column consists of the names, while the second column consists of the values.  The Fetch method simply concatenates the pairs into the specified URL, while the Update and Fetch method posts the pairs to a webserver, before fetching the resulting page.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nFor example, assume a table with the following contents is connected to the Web DAT:\t\t\t\n\n{{{!}} border=\"1\"\t\t\t\n{{!}}name\t\t\t\n{{!}}joe\t\t\t\n{{!}}-\t\t\t\n{{!}}month\t\t\t\n{{!}}May\t\t\t\n{{!}}}\n\t\t\t\nIf the specified URL is:\t\t\t\n''http://www.example.com''\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThen the Fetch method will actually fetch:\t\t\t\n''http://www.example.com?name=joe&month=May''\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSimilarly, the Submit and Fetch method will post the pairs to the specified webserver, before fetching the page.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nNote that spaces and other special characters in the table will be properly encoded. For example, each space in a name or value would be encoded as: %20\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe first input can also be text data, in which case the data is sent to the webserver during a POST as-is, without any formatting or encoding. If the first input is text it will be ignored during a GET operation.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe 2nd input of the Web DAT can be used for custom HTTP request headers to be specified as part of the request. Like the 1st input this should be a table of name/value pairs for header field name and the value. E.g\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n{{{!}} border=\"1\"\t\t\t\n{{!}}Content-Type\t\t\t\n{{!}}application/json\t\t\t\n{{!}}-\t\t\t\n{{!}}Date\t\t\t\n{{!}}Tue, 12 Nov 2013 08:12:31 GMT\t\t\t\n{{!}}}\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nEach row will automatically be merged into a single line of text separated by a colon. If the 2nd column is empty then the entry in the first column will have a semi-color append to it when it's turned into the request header.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nSee also [[XML DAT]], [[TCP/IP DAT]], [[WebSocket DAT]].",

Once formatted, selected sections of the text can be output for further processing.\t\t\n\t\t\t\nOne approach to parsing with the XML DAT is to read the XML with a Text DAT or a Web DAT, and pass that to a default XML DAT. Then you start to refine your selection by changing the match-all pattern (the \"*\"), to strings that reduce the elements that are in the output.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n===<div class=\"subSectionLineDAT\">XML and HTML Background</div>===\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nXML and HTML data consists of a tree like structure consisting of elements. Each element can be either tagged or contain arbitrary text. Elements may be nested. Tagged elements begin with an opening section and usually are terminated with a closing section.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nExample:\t\t\t\n  <nowiki><greeting a=\"1\" b=\"2\" c=\"3\"> Hello there. </greeting></nowiki>\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nIn the example above are two elements. The first is a '''tag''' element named ''greeting'' with attributes ''a, b'' and ''c''. The second element is a '''text''' element consisting of \"''Hello there.''\"\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n===<div class=\"subSectionLineDAT\">XML DAT Operation</div>===\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe XML DAT begins by parsing its input, creating an internal tree of elements.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe '''Element Scope''' parameters are then used to filter out unwanted elements. The remaining elements are then used to create the output. The format of the output is determined by the '''Format''' parameters. The '''Output''' parameters can then be used to futher limit the information displayed for each scoped element.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nEach parsed element contains a number of details:\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Label''' - Each element is given an arbitrary label named n0, n1, n2 etc. All elements are children of the reserved element labelled 'root'.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Type''' - Elements are mainly of type 'tag' or 'text', though tag types can be further classified into 'doctype', 'declaration', 'comment' or 'entity'.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Text''' - The text of an element refers to the tag attribute of an element, or the arbitrary text contents. In the above example, the first element would be of type 'tag' and contain text of 'greeting'. The second element would be of type 'text' and contain text of 'Hello there.'\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Level''' - This describes how deeply nested an element is. For example the single root element always has a level of 0.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Parent''' - Each element contains one parent. The root element does not have a parent.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Children''' - Each element can have an arbitrary number of children elements.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n'''Attributes''' - Each tagged element can have an arbitrary number of attributes. Each attribute consists of a name and a value. In the above example, the greeting tag would contain 3 attributes (with names a, b and c and values 1, 2, and 3 respectively).",

It draws edges (like polygon edges), points and vectors from points. There are different parameters to control the desired shape, as explained in the Parameter sections.\nIt renders several primitive types: polygons, meshes, NURBS, quads, etc. It also manages closed polygons / open polygons.\n\nYou can render a dot at each point. You can render a vector at each point which uses any attribute, like Normal (N). The points or vectors can have their own colors and alpha.\n\nLine Width is a resolution-independent quantity. A line width of 1 will draw a line that is 1/1000 the width of the image. This is true when used with orthographic cameras and perspective cameras. \n\nTo make the width of a line and its points vary per-point of a SOP, the width can be set by adding a point attribute <code>width</code> on the SOP being rendered. A value of 2 scales the width at that point by 2 times its normal width. New point attributes can be created with the [[Point SOP]] Custom page. To affect per-point width and not affect the line width, use the point attribute <code>pscale</code>.\n\nWhen you are animating Ortho Width or Field of View, you may want line widths to adjust more realistically. When the parameter \"Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width\" is on, the behavior is different: For Ortho cameras, the drawn line width increases when Ortho Width drops below 1, (as if you are zooming into it), and decreases when Ortho Width increases above 1. For Perspective cameras, the drawn line width increases when Field of View drops below 90 degrees, and decreases when Field of View increases above 90 degrees. Note that when the parameter \"Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width\" is on, lines are still resolution-independent.\n\nIntro article here from Interactive Immersive HQ: [https://interactiveimmersive.io/blog/3d/new-superpowers-touchdesigners-line-mat/ new-superpowers-touchdesigners-line-mat/]",

'''If no shaders are listed in the dialog''', it means no shader has been rendered in the current session of TouchDesigner. Turn on the viewer for the Phong MAT, or setup a render in a Render TOP.

You can output its [[:Category:GLSL|GLSL shader]] into two [[DAT]]s for further adaptation in a [[GLSL MAT]] by using the Output Shader parameter.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nPhong Shading models three types of reflected light:\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n* Ambient - Ambient is considered light that does not come from any particular direction and is therefore constant across the surface. In the physical world, ambient light is created from the reflection of light off surfaces in the environment.\t\t\t\t\n* Diffuse - Diffuse models the light reflected by matte surfaces. This light is reflected equally in all directions, therefore the position of the observer does not effect the percieved illumination.\t\t\t\t\n* Specular - Specular models the light reflected by glossy surfaces. This light is reflected mainly in the direction of the reflected ray and is attenuated by the 'shiny-ness' of an object. Since the light reflected from the surface is mainly in the direction of the reflected ray, the position of the observer determines the specular highlight on the surface.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n<blockquote>\t\t\t\t\n'''NOTE:''' We see the color of an object because of the color of light that the material reflects.\t\n</blockquote>\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nPhong Shading produces very nice specular highlights, although it is still an approximation and not physically accurate.  Contrasting with the Gouraud shading model that calculates the lighting at each vertex and interpolates the value across the polygon, Phong calculates the lighting at each pixel.\n\nTo see how all of the different parts are summed together by looking at the [[Phong Lighting Equation]] article.",
